# LLULL
Project proposal for the Mutek festival (Montreal, 2019) dedicated to [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull), Catalan philosopher and mystic born in Mallorca in the 12th century

## Performance
* This project proposes a audiovisual performance of approximately 30 minutes where a limited number of settings carefully calibrated are manipulated to generate the nine-part A/V work. (see [Concept](#concept) section) The minimal and experimental aesthetic wants itself to be accessible as well as transcendent. Musically, the performance is inspired by the **minimal techno, ambient and dub currents**
* One of the authors goal is to aligning with the transparency philosophy of Open Source. This is why manipulations will be captured and projected to offer viewers the chance to perceive the effect of the manual interventions affecting both the sounds they hear and the shapes they see. We feel this approach is often overlooked by many artists. At the same time, it is one of the innovative aspects of this particular project

### Summary
* Synthetic and minimal music (1 synthesizer + 1 drum machine) live
* **Generative Art** (written in JavaScript) customized and **controlled live**
  * [Description of the project’s visual components (PDF)](/PDF/LLULL-visuals-v1.pdf)
* **Simultaneous control** of sound and image with the synthesizer and the drum machine (via MIDI control)
* Length: 30 minutes

## Ramon Llull

>Still today, Llull inspires a large number of creators working in multiple fields (visual arts, music, philosophy, politics, etc.). Among other things, the combinatorial and algorithmic principles developed by Llull have played a fundamental role in the evolution of human thought. Llull's work has certainly fostered all kinds of technological advances that led to the digital and artistic revolution in which we live

## Concept
* Llul suggests the use of reasoning to achieve "perfection"
* This quest is symbolized by the 9-level knowledge staircase
* The authors proposes a musical experience through these different stages
* Each scene contains a different question that invites the viewer to reason

## Technology
* Audio + Control
  * Moog Sub Phatty
  * Roland TR-8
